        My name is Sabrina Starr. I live in Leesburg Virginia, and have a 9 month old puppy
        named River, and enjoy riding my unicycle in my free time. I also have an amazing husband. We love to go on adventures.

        Why I Want to Learn How to Code

    <article>
        I love math, and I love logic. I love to solve problems, and think analytically. This is a 
        huge reason why I am attracted to software engineering. It's what you get to do all day! 
        You get to tap into both your right and left sides of your brain as you both solve a problem
        and build something beautiful. It's mesmerizing.
